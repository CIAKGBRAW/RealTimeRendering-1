-----When using glTexImage2d() 7th parameter i.e which specifies format of texel data, when applied texture,
texture color changes eg- if we give GL_BGR our pyramid stone texture color changes to blue.
If we apply GL_RGB then original texture color is displayed.


----- Output initially did not displayed (i.e Andhaar) becuase call to cull face i.e glEnable(GL_CULL_FACE);
was not and uncommnted.As soon as we comment this line i.e off cull ,output smiley gets displayed.
Reason must be as quad we are showing is single front face and if we cull that single face then no output will be
displayed.
